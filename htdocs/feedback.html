          <h3 id="needhelp">Finding help on validation and Web authoring</h3>
          <p>Your page doesn't validate, and you don't know why, or
          you have a question about <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, 
          stylesheets or validation?</p>
          <p>
          <strong>First, check our <a href="docs/help.html">Help and <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> document</a>, as well as the
            <a href="https://www.htmlhelp.com/faq/">Web authoring <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr></a>
            to see if your question has been answered there.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
          The two most common problems are:
          <a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/problems.html#amp">Validating pages with 
            ampersands (&amp;'s) in
            <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr></a> and
          <a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/problems.html#script">Validating pages with 
            JavaScript: <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
            in a <code>SCRIPT</code> Element</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
          If your problem isn't covered by one of the resources above,
          you can send it to one of the following forums:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Usenet newsgroup: <code><a href="news:comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html">comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html</a></code></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.hwg.org/"><abbr
                   title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> Writers Guild</a>
              <a title="HTML Writers Guild Mailing Lists"
                 href="http://www.hwg.org/lists/">mailing lists</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
          Each of these forums have plenty of experienced <abbr
          title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
          authors who are willing to share their expertise. If you are
          commenting on a specific page, be sure to provide a
          <abbr title="Universal Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
          when you ask your question!
          </p>


          <h3 id="errormsg">Error message feedback</h3>
          <p>If you think the error messages in the Markup Validator's result pages could be improved, or are not comprehensible, 
          you can send questions and suggestions to our mailing-list.</p>

          <p>If you do not understand an error while validating a page, or if you need help on validation, <strong>read the FAQ</strong> and help 
          (see the section <a href="#needhelp">Finding help on validation</a>) and <strong>search the list archives</strong> for existing mail threads on the topic
          <strong>before sending any message to the mailing-list</strong>.</p>



          <p>Before you send any feedback on error messages, we encourage you to search the archives for existing messages on this error 
          in case your feedback has already been sent, or answers to 
          your query have already been given. </p>



          <form method="get" action="https://www.w3.org/Search/Mail/Public/search">
            <p>Search the archives of the www-validator mailing-list:<br>
            <input id="type-index" name="type-index" type="hidden" value="www-validator">
            <input id="index-type" name="index-type" type="hidden" value="t">

            <input id="keywords" name="keywords" type="text" size="33" maxlength="100" value="">

            <input type="submit" id="mailsearch" name="search" value="Search Mail Archives">
            </p>
          </form>

          <p>Once you have checked that your suggestion has not been given yet, you can send your message. To write an efficient message:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Add a meaningful subject line</strong>: summarize your feedback in a handful of words;</li>
            <li>If our system added [VE][XX] at the beginning of the mail subject, keep it. 
              Otherwise, please precise which error message you are sending feedback about;</li>
            <li><strong>Give some context</strong>. Generally speaking, this means <strong>give the URL</strong> of the page you were trying to validate.
              The more context you give, the easier it will be for others to understand your problem, question or feedback.
            </li>
            <li><strong>What is your feedback?</strong>. Explain your suggestion, or question, in a clear and informative manner. Be precise and thorough.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Once you have checked all the criteria above, 
          <a href="mailto:www-validator@w3.org?Subject=%20Add%20Subject%20Here&amp;body=%0D%0A%0D%0ANOTE%3A%20Whenever%20possible%2C%20give%20the%20address%20of%20the%20document%20you%20were%20checking.">send your message to the www-validator public mailing-list</a>.
          </p>

          </p>

          <p>
          If you just want to have an informal discussion with developers and users of the Validator, 
          you may also join the IRC channel #validator on the 
          <a href="https://freenode.net/">freenode</a> network (irc.freenode.net).
          However, please keep in mind that <em>this is not a support channel</em>.
          </p>

          <h3 id="bugreport">Bug reports</h3>
          <p>
          W3C tracks bug reports on the validator through the GitHub repositories
          where the code is maintained. Developers
          and other technical users can log bug reports and feature suggestions
          directly. If you are not familiar with issue tracking systems in general,
          send your feedback to the <a href="#mailinglist">mailing list</a>
          and someone on the W3C Validator Team will take care of logging your
          issue as appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>There are two distinct repositories where issues can be filed; if you're not sure which to use, pick the first one and we will take care of transferring it if necessary:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/markup-validator">(X)HTML validator</a> which is used to validate HTML4 and XHTML documents, and provides the shared front-end for markup validation;</li>
            <li>the <a href="https://github.com/validator/validator/">NU validator</a> which is the most actively maintained project, used to validate HTML5 / HTML LS documents.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Before you enter a new bug, we strongly encourage you to check that it is not yet in the list of opened issues.</p>
